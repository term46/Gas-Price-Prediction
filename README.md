# Gas-Price-Prediction

Using R I analzyed over 30 years of unleaded gasoline in the United States to predict the price of gasoline in US dollars for the next year.
I analyzed the time-series data using  an auto ARIMA model and a Holt-Winters model with AR(1) to determine which was a better predictor.
The auto ARIMA model proved to have a slightly lower RMSE of 0.118 compared to the HW model with 0.126.
